# # # # # # # #
# this script is intended to perform full vacuum of certain CFME tables periodically
# caution needs to be used with full vacuum as each of these tables will become locked
# for update until the full vacuum is completed. CFME replication may be adversly
# impacted by the indiscriminant use of this or other such maintenance processes
# which locks tables that replication may trying to update.  therefore, when this
# process is initiated it is recommended that replication be suspended until this
# maintenance process is completed, or that the user be prepared to restart and
# possibly re-sync tables should replication become stalled while this process 
# is active.  The verbose option of the vacuum has been added so that additional
# information about record counts, removed tuples and total pages as well as 
# execution time is captured into the output file for possible later review.
#
# the expected operational environment for this script is that it is executing
# on the host/appliance where the CFME PostgreSQL VMDB is executing.  The command
# initiation sequence does not contain either userid or host reference as it
# is expected that the pg_hba.conf is configured to trust linux socket connections
# and not require these.
# 
# a full vacuum for the ems_events table has been added to this which did 
# exist in previous versions of this document as this is the table that is used
# when UI timelines are being created and a reorganiztion of this table
# periodically should allow that process to complete in a more timely manner.
# by default this table is commented out (ie, is preceeded by two dashes '--')
# 
# Caution: PostgreSQL version 9.0 and later has changed the way that vacuum full
#           operates.  In prior versions, there was no need to have additional
#           space available in the file system to perform vacuum full operations.
#           However, with version 9.0 the vacuum full operation copies the source
#           table (ie the table being vacuumed) to a completely new table which 
#           temporarily increases the required space in the filesystem where the 
#           database exists.  After the copy and rebuild of the indexes is 
#           completed the old tables and indexes are delete and the newly created
#           ones renamed to the old names.
#
# this script is also altered to adapt to the requirements introduced in the
# CFME 3.1 version which required the use of 'scl enable postgresql92 -- ' as a
# command prefix due to the introduction of PostgreSQL as a software collection
# not in the default search path.  It is possible that this command may need to
# adapt in the future if a new version of PostgreSQL is introduced other than the
# current PostgreSQL version 9.2 which this command references.

# unlike the hourly re-index commands these are intended to run squentially
# so that there is minimal impact to the operating environment (ie, filesystem) 
# as it is expected that these operations will have a longer duration than
# the hourly reindex transactions.
#
# any single vacuum can be removed by preceding the word "vacuum" with two dashes
# eg "--vacuum full hosts" will prevent the vacuum from operating on the 'hosts'
# table
