# this script is created to address the situation where the index set for realtime
# C&U tables are not being deleted/removed removed from metrics_* tables in any
# environment running the CloudForms Management Engine 2.0 or 3.x  code.
# this code addresses the issue continuously by truncating the table that is 
# 23 hours old so that when it is empty (4 hour default retention period) both
# base table and indices are emptied and reset preventing the slow bloat of the
# index set which otherwise happens.
# this is expected to to installed and execute on only one appliance in the  
# environment where the VMDB is being hosted.

# -  added truncate query as commented text in case it should be needed
# -  changed output to *.log file so that logrotate manages the output file.
